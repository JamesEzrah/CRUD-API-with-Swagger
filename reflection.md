Discuss: Why is API documentation important in real projects?

API documentation is important in real projects because it helps developers understand how to use the API correctly, saving time and avoiding mistakes. It acts like a user manual, showing what the API can do, how to connect with it, what data to send, and what to expect in return. Without clear documentation, developers can get confused, make errors, or waste hours trying to figure things out. Good documentation also makes teamwork smoother and helps new team members get up to speed faster.
